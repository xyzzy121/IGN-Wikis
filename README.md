# IGN Wikis
 A crawl of various wikis on IGN.
 
		My Monologue
 IGN Wikis are <b>Very</b> Crawlable, as they don't involve accessing urls on the same level like MediaWiki wikis do.
 For example:
 A MediaWiki home page might be wiki.com/mainpage. It has a link to wiki.com/page1.  Now most web crawlers see this as being "above the root" which means that 
 It is on a separate branch of the website.  This makes sense and usually works, since if you are crawling one branch of the website say ign.com/wikis, you don't want ign.com/games as well. 
 but since MediaWiki keeps its pages on the same depth crawling them is usually much more annoying, unless you are willing to wait a week or so.
 Fandom Wikis don't suffer from this problem, as individual topics are their own separate website, however, their pages have so much... stuff in them that not only
 do they take a while to load anyways, but the crawler can't decipher the javascript without an extension of some sort.  Or at least that's my theory.  I don't know how true it is.
 
 But anyways this is a crawl of various wikis for your convenience. Enjoy.


		Getting Started
		
There are two ways to get started.  They both start with this step:
1.) you click on index-webcopy.html (or SITEMAP!!!.html if I still have one of those somewhere in these crawls.)

from here you can do two things
a.) you can scroll down and look for the wiki home page
b.) you can click on anything and navigate back to the main page.

If you really want, you can just go through the folders and open pages that way. but I wouldn't recommend it.
